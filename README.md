# API testing with HTTParty
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chaoscifer/api-testing-with-httparty.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chaoscifer/api-testing-with-httparty) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/chaoscifer/api-testing-with-httparty/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/chaoscifer/api-testing-with-httparty)

This project contains some examples on how to use HTTParty to test your API.

### What are we testing?

All the tests will run against a local fake api (Beernivore.com), which is a imaginary (that in fact runs local with Sinatra) cloud service to check if there is some animal on your booze.

### What are we using?

> ### HTTParty: Makes http fun again!
