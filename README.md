# API testing with HTTParty

This project contains some examples on how to use HTTParty to test your API.

### What are we testing?

All the tests will run against a local fake api (Beernivore-api.com), which is imaginary (that in fact runs local with Sinatra) cloud service to check if there is some animal on your booze.
